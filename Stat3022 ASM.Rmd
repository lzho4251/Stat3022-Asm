## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

1）
$$toatl=1045.9715-3.6242*ratio + 1.6379*salary+4.4626*expend-2.9045*perc$$


2）
They are not contradiction
For t-test
H0: total~ratio+expend+prec
H1: total~ratio+expend+prec+Salary
it is the full model(assume other variable all in the model) with and without Salary

For f-test:
H0: total~ratio
H1: total~ratio+Salary
the F test check whether at least Salary has to be in the model
  
f=(53055/1)/(48124/45)~F(1,45)

3)
There are not obvious violation of constant variance and normality,just some potential outliers

4)
From model A ,44 Utah,29 New Hampshire,34 North Dakota can be considered as influential observation
From DFFITS view: we would think if the value is larger than 2*(sqrt(p/n)) 
which is 2*(sqrt(5/50)) ,then the value can be considered as influential observation.
2*(sqrt(5/50))   >> 44 Utah,29 New Hampshire,34 North Dakota


outlier:
|extResiduals|should be larger than t(1-alpha/2,n-1-p)
that is 
```{r}
qt(0.975,44) 
```
44 Utah,34 North Dakota,29 New Hampshire
 
 
leverage:
hii should be larger than  2*p/n 
or 3*p/n
2*5/50 = 0.2 
3*5/50 = 0.3  
44 Utah 


5)
The model may have Multicollinearity problem:
regression parameters  are difficult to interpret, we can not conclude that the effect of ratio and salary  are  different. when new variables are added, the OLS estimates can change daramatically

```{r}
vif1<-1/(1-0.5890192)
vif2<-1/(1-0.8915076)
vif3<-1/(1-0.8943512)
vif4<-1/(1-0.4302286)
c(vif1,vif2,vif3,vif4)
```


7)
```{r}
VIF<-1/(1-0.8246)
VIF
```
Model A has serious multicollinearity.From ggpairs plot, salary and expend are high correlated,we may exclude covariate expend from the model to solve this problem

cannot reject h0  vs+qsec:vs is insignficiant
the effect of 1/4 mile time on fuel consumption does not depends on engine shape

```{r}

qf(0.95,2,27)

```
we can reject H0  am+qsec:am is signficiant
the effect of 1/4 mile time on fuel consumption depends on transmission types 


```{r}
anova(modd)
```
we only have to include qsec:am and am in the model
